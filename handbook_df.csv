" At Will Employment  Employment with the Company is at-will. Neither you nor the Company has entered into a contract  about the duration of your employment, and you are free to terminate your employment with the  Company at any time, with or without cause, and with or without reason. Likewise, the Company has  the right, in its sole discretion, at any time, to terminate your employment, with or without cause, and  with or without reason, and may otherwise discipline, transfer, or demote you at any time.

",145
" Equal Employment Opportunity  The Company is an equal opportunity employer and strictly adheres to all applicable fair employment  practices, laws, and regulations. Discrimination in employment on the basis of any classification protected  under federal, state, or local law is a violation of Company policy and is illegal. To the extent protected  by applicable law, the Company does not discriminate in hiring or employment on the basis of race, color,  religion, sex, pregnancy, sexual orientation, gender, gender identity, gender expression, national origin,  age, disability, genetic information, veteran status, or any other characteristic protected by applicable  law.  This policy applies to all terms and conditions of employment, including, but not limited to, recruitment,  hiring, placement, training, promotion, separation of employment, reduction in force, recalls, transfers,  leaves of absence, benefits, and compensation.   The Company will make reasonable accommodations to the extent required by law with respect to an  employee’s religious beliefs or practices, pregnancy, or disability.   The Company requires employees to immediately report any incident of discrimination which they have  experienced or observed to either their immediate supervisor or a People Team Member. The Company  will promptly investigate all complaints of discrimination, take all reasonable steps to end the  discrimination, and prohibits retaliation against employees for reporting discrimination or participating in  an investigation related to discrimination.   ",259
" Accommodations  The Company will make good faith efforts to provide a reasonable accommodation to the known physical  or mental limitations of qualified employees with disabilities unless the accommodation would create an  undue hardship. Employees who believe they are qualified and have a physical or mental impairment that  is a disability, as defined by applicable law, should contact a People Team Member.  The Company will make good faith efforts to provide a reasonable accommodation of the sincerely held  religious beliefs of its employees to the extent such accommodation does not create an undue hardship.  To request such an accommodation, please contact a People Team Member. 5  The Company will also make any additional accommodations to the extent required under applicable law.  If you believe you need an accommodation to perform the essential functions of your position, please  contact a People Team Member or your supervisor.  The Company will not take adverse action against an employee because the employee requests or uses a  reasonable accommodation which is required under applicable law.   ",180
" Employment of Relatives  Family members of employees may be considered for employment as long as the family relationship is  disclosed in advance to a People Team Member and the circumstances of employment do not create an  actual or apparent conflict of interest. Employees cannot supervise (either directly or indirectly) a family  member, or otherwise be in a position to affect the other employee’s compensation, benefits, performance, or career advancement. The Company will determine whether the employment of relatives  poses an actual or potential conflict and the appropriate resolution to the actual or potential conflict in  accordance with applicable law. For purposes of this policy, the term “family members” includes parents,  stepparents, spouses, domestic partners, children, stepchildren, brothers, sisters, children’s spouses,  grandparents, grandchildren, in-laws or any individual for whom the employee is the primary care  provider.  ",164
" Relationships in the Workplace  The Company respects the right of individuals to develop and engage in personal relationships with others  they work with. As long as a personal relationship with another employee is consensual and does not  involve a reporting relationship, give rise to favoritism, or create any actual or apparent conflict of interest,  such relationships are permitted. Any romantic relationship between two Company employees must be  disclosed to a People Team Member if one employee has a supervisory role with respect to the other  employee or otherwise is in a position to affect the other employee’s compensation, benefits,  performance, or career advancement. In such an event, the Company will determine whether the  situation poses an actual or potential conflict and the appropriate resolution to the actual or potential  conflict in accordance with applicable law.  WORK TIME AND COMPENSATION  ",152
" Employee Classifications  The Company complies with the Fair Labor Standards Act (“FLSA”) and any applicable state or local wage  and hour laws. The Company classifies positions as “non-exempt” or “exempt” based on duties,  responsibilities, whether the position is paid on a salary or hourly basis, and the salary level or hourly  wage rate.  • Exempt employees are generally those in certain administrative, executive, professional, and in  some jurisdictions, certain computer positions, outside sales, and highly compensated employees  who are paid on a salaried basis to compensate these employees for all hours worked. Exempt  employees do not receive overtime pay.   • Non-exempt employees are generally those in other positions and receive overtime pay for  working overtime hours as required by applicable federal, state, and local laws and regulations.   For confirmation of whether a specific job is exempt or non-exempt, or for questions regarding whether  a job was correctly designated, employees should contact a People Team Member.  6  ",183
" Hours of Work  Standard hours of work vary depending on location and position.  The Company classifies employees as full-time, part-time or temporary for purposes of benefits:  • Full-time employees are regularly scheduled to work 35 or more hours per week. • Part-time employees are regularly scheduled to work less than 35 hours per week.  • Temporary employees are those that temporarily supplement the workforce or assist in the  completion of a specific project and are scheduled to work for a limited time period.  Generally, full-time employees are eligible for Company benefits subject to the terms and eligibility  requirements of the benefit plan or policy. Part-time and temporary employees are generally not eligible  for benefits unless required by law or the applicable plan or policy.  ",133
" Attendance and Punctuality  Attendance and punctuality are essential requirements of every position. Unnecessary absences and  lateness are expensive, disruptive and place an unfair burden on other employees and supervisors.  Excessive absenteeism or tardiness will result in disciplinary action up to and including discharge.  We do recognize, however, that there are times when absences or tardiness cannot be avoided. In such  cases, employees are expected to notify their supervisor as early as possible, and prior to the start of the  workday. Asking another employee, friend or relative to give this notice is not sufficient. Employees  should inform their supervisor of the absence and its expected duration, before the start time every day  that the employee is absent. Unreported absences of three consecutive workdays is considered job  abandonment and a voluntary resignation from employment.  ",148
" Pay Periods  The Company complies with all applicable laws governing the frequency of pay, payday schedules, and  pay upon termination of employment. Employees are paid on a bi-weekly basis. Each employee’s payroll  stub itemizes deductions and includes other information as required by applicable law. Employees should carefully review payroll stubs and bring any errors to the attention of a People Team Member immediately. Any necessary adjustments to paychecks will be made in the next payroll cycle or sooner if  required under applicable law.   ",92
" Timekeeping Procedures  Employees must record their actual time worked in our HRIS system for payroll and benefit purposes.  Non-exempt employees must record the time work begins and ends, as well as the beginning and ending  time of any departure from work. Non-exempt employees may not start work until their scheduled  starting time.  Exempt employees are required to report full days of absence from work for reasons such as vacation,  leaves of absence, sick leave or personal business.  Altering, falsifying or tampering with time records, or working “off the clock” are strictly prohibited.  Employees are responsible for certifying the accuracy of all time recorded. Any errors in time records  should be reported immediately to the employee’s supervisor or a People Team Member. 7  ",138
" Overtime Pay for Non-Exempt Employees  It is sometimes necessary for employees to work overtime. Non-exempt employees must obtain written  approval from their supervisor in advance of working any hours that would trigger overtime pay. The  Company will pay non-exempt employees overtime pay at the rate of time and one-half the regular rate  of pay for all hours actually worked over 40 during the established work week. The Company will also pay  overtime to the extent required under any applicable state or local law.  The Company will pay for overtime even if the employee does not obtain advanced written authorization  from the supervisor as required. However, anyone who works unauthorized overtime may be subject to  disciplinary action up to and including termination. Paid or unpaid time off pursuant to any Company  policy (for example, paid time off, holidays, sick time), will not be counted as hours worked for purposes  of determining whether an employee is entitled to receive overtime pay.  For questions about overtime pay or any state-specific overtime requirements, contact a People Team  Member.   ",190
" Lactation Breaks  The Company will provide a reasonable amount of break time during the workday, in addition to the  standard breaks that an employee receives, to accommodate an employee’s need to express milk for the  employee’s infant child for up to two years after the birth of the child. In certain circumstances where  permitted by law, such additional break time provided may be unpaid for non-exempt employees. The  Company will provide a room or other private location appropriate for the expression of milk. The  Company will also comply with any additional requirements under applicable state and local laws.   ",109
 Breaks and Meal Periods  Employees are provided with breaks and meal periods according to Company policy and applicable wage  and hour laws.   ,23
" Salary for Exempt Employees  Exempt employees are generally paid a fixed salary for their job responsibilities, without regard to the  number of hours needed in a work week to complete the job. Exempt employees are not eligible for  overtime pay but are required to spend whatever hours are necessary to fulfill their job responsibilities.  Similarly, regardless of variations in the number of days or hours worked or the quality of the work  performed, the Company will not make deductions from an exempt employee’s salary for any work week  in which the employee worked, unless such deductions are authorized by law.  There are certain circumstances where deductions from the salaries of exempt employees are  permissible. Improper deductions for exempt employees are prohibited by the Company. Any employee  who is exempt and believes that an improper deduction has been made to his or her salary should  immediately notify a People Team Member. The Company will promptly review and investigate any  complaint and will reimburse any employee found to have been subject to an improper salary deduction. 8  TIME AWAY FROM WORK  ",192
" Holidays  The Company generally recognizes ten paid holidays each calendar year. Holiday pay is paid at eight hours per holiday and is not included in the calculation of overtime. Holidays may shift during the year  depending on the day on which they fall, but generally follow the list below:  Annual Holidays:   • New Year’s Day  • Good Friday  • Memorial Day  • Juneteenth  • Independence Day (July 4)  • Labor Day  • Thanksgiving Day  • Day After Thanksgiving  • Christmas Day  • Floating holiday (1)  ",96
" Paid Time Off (PTO)  The Company believes in offering both a generous and flexible Paid Time Off (“PTO”) program that allows  employees to work directly with their supervisor to manage the time an employee needs away from work  for instances such as personal time, vacation, and sick time.. PTO is provided to all full-time employees  and administered in accordance with Company policies and applicable state law.. Please refer to the state  specific addendum of the state where you work for further details about any state-specific paid leave  details.. Expectations for Employees Taking Leave  It is the expectation that employees taking leave adhere to the following expectations:  • Submit the leave at least 2 weeks in advance using our HRIS system unless the need for leave is  unforeseeable and related to sickness, a public health emergency, or domestic violence.. • Communicate regularly with your team that you will be out and develop a clear handover or  coverage plan to your team so your customers and responsibilities will be managed while you are  away.. • Understand that not all leave requests can be honored at all times due to staffing shortages, high  priority business needs and deadlines, or other business reasons.. Discuss your plans early with  your manager with this in mind.. • You’re able to meet your goals despite your absence.. If you’re taking a substantial amount of  leave without meeting your goals, this may indicate an issue with performance that will be  addressed, and leave may subsequently be denied.. • That you are informing a People Team Member if your leave is related to illness, leave of absence,  or potentially part of an FMLA request.. 9  Full-Time Exempt Employees  Full-time exempt employees are eligible to take flexible leave.. Employees may use flexible leave in any  increments of time.. There are no minimum allowances of maximum limits on flexible leave, subject to  the Company’s notice and approval process, unless the time off is for a reason that qualifies for family or  medical leave, military leave, parental leave, and/or short-term disability:  • Family and Medical Leave – Flexible leave may be used to extend the period of family medical  leave.. • Parental Leave – Flexible leave may be used to extend the period of parental leave.. Employees  who need parental leave are eligible for compensation as provided in the Parental Leave policy.. • Short-Term Disability – Flexible leave may be used to extend the period of or increase  compensation during other types of leave which qualify for short-term disability benefits.. Flexible  leave may be used during the wait period for short-term disability benefits.. • Military Leave – Flexible leave may not be used to extend the period of military leave.. Up to two  weeks of flexible leave may be applied to provide compensation during military leave.. Flexible leave is not accrued or earned and is not paid out upon termination.. Exempt employees are able  to review their leave history in our HRIS system..",541
" Parental Leave  The Company may grant a full-time employee a paid Parental Leave of Absence. Parental Leave is paid  leave associated with the birth of an employee’s own child or the placement of a child with the employee  in connection with adoption or foster care. The Company reserves the right to deny Parental Leave in  accordance with applicable law. 10  For birthing parents, this includes two (2) paid weeks of parental leave in addition to paid time off. For  non-birthing parents, this includes two (2) weeks of paid parental leave in a 6-month period as measured  from the first day of an employee’s leave, as well as paid time off. Eligible employees are also entitled to  utilizing short-term disability for their parental leave. If you would like more information about short  term disability, reach out to a People team member.   An employee may request Parental Leave by submitting their leave in our HRIS system, and during the  leave, the Company maintains the employee’s health coverage under any group plan on the same terms  as if the employee had continued to work. Employees must continue to pay their portion of any insurance  premium while on leave.  When the need for leave is foreseeable, the employee must provide the Company with at least sixty days  advance notice as well as assist with planning for coverage during their absence. When the timing of the  leave is not foreseeable, the employee must provide the Company with notice for the need for leave as  soon as its reasonably practicable under the circumstances.  In addition to requesting the leave, the employee is responsible for communicating with a People Team  Member during the leave regarding, among other things, changes in status and contact information. In  addition, the employee is responsible for cooperating with the People Team Member by responding  promptly to all requests for information by e-mail or telephone.   Before an employee performs any work on behalf of the Company after taking Parental Leave, the  employee may be required to submit a Fit for Duty form completed and signed by the employee’s health  care provider that states whether the employee is able to perform the essential functions of the  employee’s job, with or without a reasonable accommodation.

If an employee substitutes paid leave for FMLA leave, the  employee must comply with the Company’s normal paid leave policies, and such paid leave will run  concurrently with FMLA leave.. Benefits and Protections  While employees are on FMLA leave, the Company will continue health insurance coverage as if the  employees were not on leave.. Upon return from FMLA leave, most employees must be restored to the same job or one nearly identical  to it with equivalent pay, benefits, and other employment terms and conditions..

Military  orders should be presented to a People Team Member and arrangements for leave made as early as  possible before departure. Employees must notify a People Team Member of their intent to return to  employment as required by applicable law. No attempt is made in this policy to cover all possible  applicable laws and circumstances that may arise when an employee is ordered to active duty. Therefore,  as military leave situations arise, employees should consult with a People Team Member for current and  complete details regarding their military leave rights. 13  ",151
" Volunteer Time Off (VTO)  The Company strives to be a good corporate citizen and take an active interest in the well-being of the  communities in which it operates. As such, the Company encourages its employees to volunteer in their  local community. Full-time employees may request one paid day off each calendar year to volunteer to  help those in need. VTO is not included in the calculation of overtime. VTO is refreshed at the beginning  of each calendar year, cannot be accrued or carried over into the following year, and is not paid out upon  termination. Additional volunteer time off may be paid through approved PTO.   As a condition of this benefit, the Company requires that your request be in good faith and follow the  intent of this policy. Examples of appropriate uses for VTO: volunteering at a local food bank; coaching a  basketball team of disadvantaged youth; becoming a Big Brother/Big Sister; sitting on a non-profit board.  Examples of inappropriate uses for VTO: coaching your child’s sports team; attending your child’s PTA  conference; or using VTO for non-volunteer reasons.
